##Description

The railway management system allows passengers to enquire about available trains based on their boarding station  and arrival station, purchase and cancel tickets, and check the status of their booked tickets, among other things. The goal of this case study is to design and develop a database that stores information about various trains, train status, and passengers. The number, name, source, destination, and days on which the train is available are all included in the train record, whereas the train status record includes the dates for which tickets can be booked, the total number of seats available, and the number of seats already booked.

Passengers may look for trains by entering the boarding station, arrival station, and date of travel. If there are any trains available, they will be displayed. Following that, passengers may book their tickets. A ticket with the Passenger Details will be generated, and a confirmation email with the ticket details will be issued to the user. If a passenger wishes to cancel their tickets, they must first input their PNR number and then cancel them.Passengers can also search the running status of the train by entering train number and date of journey.
